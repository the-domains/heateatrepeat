# Cinnamon Rolls

I eventually found my way to this recipe while searching out the best cinnamon roll recipe. This one wins! Sticky, gooey, sweet and perfect for satisfying a craving for cinnamon rolls (or cinnamon buns).

\*The coffee has been upped a bit from the original, and the maple was left out in favor for some vanilla.

### Dough

#### Ingredients

2 Cups **milk**

1⁄2 Cup **vegetable oil**

1⁄2 Cup **sugar**

1 package (0.25 ounce) **active dry yeast**

4 1⁄5 Cups **all-purpose flour**

1⁄2 tsp **baking powder** heaping

1⁄2 tsp **baking soda** scant

1⁄2 Tbsp **salt** heaping

1 stick **butter** more if you like

1 Cup **sugar** more if you like

generous sprinkling **cinnamon**

#### Instructions

1. For the dough, heat the milk, vegetable oil, and sugar in a medium saucepan over medium heat to just below a boil. Set aside and cool to warm.
2. Sprinkle the yeast over the milk/oil and let it sit on the milk for 1 minute.
3. Add 4 cups of the flour. Stir until just combined, then cover with a clean kitchen towel, and set aside in a relatively warm place for 1 hour.
4. After 1 hour, remove the towel and add the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and the remaining 1/2 cup flour. Stir thoroughly to combine.
5. To assemble the rolls, remove the dough from the pan/bowl. On a floured baking surface, roll the dough into a large rectangle, about 30 x 10 inches. The dough should be rolled very thin.
6. To make the filling, pour the melted butter over the surface of the dough. Use your fingers to spread the butter evenly. Generously sprinkle half of the ground cinnamon and 1/2 cup of the sugar over the butter. Don't be afraid to drizzle on more butter or more sugar! Gooey is the goal.
7. Now, beginning at the end farthest from you, roll the rectangle tightly towards you. Use both hands and work slowly, being careful to keep the roll tight. Don't worry if the filling oozes as you work; that just means the rolls are going to be divine. When you reach the end, pinch the seam together and flip the roll so that the seam is face down. When you're finished, you'll wind up with one long buttery, cinnamony, sugary, gooey log.
8. Slip a cutting board underneath the roll and with a sharp knife, make 1/2-inch slices. One "log "will produce 20 to 25 rolls. Pour a couple of teaspoons of melted butter into disposable foil cake pans and swirl to coat. Place the sliced rolls in the pans, being careful not to overcrowd. (Each pan will hold 7 to 9 rolls.)
9. Preheat the oven to 375°F. Cover all the pans with a kitchen towel and set aside to rise on the countertop for at least 30 minutes before baking.
10. Remove the towel and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden brown. Don't allow the rolls to become overly brown.

### Icing

#### Ingredients

1 pound bag **powdered sugar**

1⁄4 Cup **milk**

1⁄4 Cup **brewed coffee**

1 tsp **vanilla extract**

2 Tbsp **butter** melted

1 pinch **salt**

#### Instructions

1. In a large bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, butter, coffee, salt, and vanilla. Whisk until very smooth. The icing should be somewhat thick but still very pourable.
2. Immediately drizzle icing over the top of the rolls when they are removed from the oven. Be sure to get it all around the edges and over the top. As they sit, the rolls will absorb some of the icing's moisture and flavor.
